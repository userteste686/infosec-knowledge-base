*CIA / CID
These three concepts form what is commonly referred to as the CIA Triad (or CID Triad). They represent the fundamental security objectives for data, information, and computing services. In Information Security, CIA and CID are core acronyms that define the three basic pillars of data protection. Although they represent the same concepts, the order of the letters varies depending on the language.

Confidentiality
Data confidentiality ensures that private or sensitive information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals. It guarantees that only authorized entities have access to the information.
Privacy ensures that individuals can control or influence which information about them may be collected and stored, and by whom and to whom such information may be disclosed. A vulnerability in confidentiality may cause an asset to be compromised or leak information, leading to incorrect operation or inaccurate results. For example, stored data values may differ from what they should be because they were improperly modified.

Integrity
Data integrity ensures that information and programs are modified only in authorized and specified ways, preventing unauthorized alteration of data.
System integrity ensures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from unauthorized manipulation, whether deliberate or accidental.

Availability
Availability ensures that systems operate promptly and that authorized users are not denied access to services. A vulnerability in availability may cause an asset to become unavailable or excessively slow, making the use of a system or network impossible or impractical.

The CIA/CID Triad is the foundation of all security decisions. Every information security measure, policy, or tool must preserve one or more of these principles. Without the CIA Triad, there is no security: if confidentiality fails, data leakage occurs; if integrity fails, data becomes corrupted or tampered with; if availability fails, service disruption occurs. For this reason, every security professional must understand and apply the CIA/CID Triad as a central reference for protecting critical systems, networks, and information.

Although the use of the CIA/CID Triad to define security objectives is well established, some security professionals believe that additional concepts are required to provide a more complete security model. Two of the most commonly cited are the following:

Authenticity
The property of being genuine, verifiable, and trustworthy; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or the originator of a message. This means verifying that users are who they claim to be and that all data received by a system originates from a trusted source.

Accountability
This security objective requires that the actions of an entity can be traced and uniquely attributed to that entity. It supports non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection and prevention, as well as recovery and legal action following an incident. Since truly secure systems are not yet an achievable goal, it must be possible to trace a security breach back to the responsible entity. Systems must maintain activity records to enable forensic analysis, allowing security violations to be traced or disputes over transactions to be resolved.
