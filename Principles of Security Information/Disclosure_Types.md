## Attack

An attack is a threat that is executed (threat action) and, if successful, results in an undesired security violation or consequence. The entity that performs the attack is referred to as the attacker or threat source agent.

An attack represents a deliberate attempt to compromise the security of a system and typically originates from an intelligent threat. It is an intentional act, often involving specific methods or techniques, designed to bypass security services and violate a system’s security policy.

## Unauthorized Disclosure
Unauthorized disclosure is a threat to confidentiality. The following types of attacks may result in this threat outcome:

### Exposure
Occurs when an entity gains unauthorized knowledge of sensitive data.

### Interception
A common attack in communication environments. In a shared local area network (LAN), such as a wireless LAN or shared Ethernet network, any connected device may receive copies of packets intended for another device.

### Inference
Inference attacks involve deriving sensitive information by observing communication patterns. A common example is traffic analysis, in which an adversary extracts information by analyzing traffic volume or communication patterns between specific systems.

### Intrusion
Occurs when an adversary gains unauthorized access to sensitive data by bypassing system access control protections.

## Fraud
Fraud is a threat to system integrity or data integrity. The following attack types may lead to this threat outcome:

### Masquerade (Impersonation)
Occurs when an unauthorized user attempts to gain access to a system by posing as an authorized user.

### Falsification
Refers to the alteration or replacement of valid data, or the insertion of false data into a file or database.

### Repudiation
Occurs when a user denies having sent data, received data, or possessed specific data.

## Disruption
Disruption is a threat to system availability or integrity. The following attacks may result in this threat outcome:

### Incapacitation
An attack against system availability. It may occur due to physical destruction or damage to system hardware. More commonly, it results from malicious software such as Trojans, viruses, or worms.

### Corruption
An attack against system integrity. Malicious software may cause system assets or services to operate in unintended ways. Alternatively, an attacker may gain unauthorized access and modify system functions, such as installing a backdoor.

### Obstruction
Occurs when system operation is hindered by interfering with communications, disabling communication links, altering control information, or overwhelming the system with excessive communication or processing traffic.

---

## Usurpation
Usurpation is a threat to system integrity. The following attack types may lead to this threat outcome:

### Misappropriation
Includes unauthorized use of system resources, such as theft of service. An example is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in which malware is installed on multiple systems and used to generate traffic toward a target system, consuming processor and operating system resources without authorization.

### Misuse
Occurs when malicious software or an attacker with unauthorized access uses system resources in unintended or unauthorized ways.

---

## Passive Attacks
Passive attacks involve monitoring or eavesdropping on communications. The attacker’s objective is to obtain information being transmitted. Common passive attacks include message content disclosure and traffic analysis.

Passive attacks are extremely difficult to detect because they do not involve any modification of data. Communications appear normal to both sender and receiver, who remain unaware that a third party has observed the messages or traffic patterns. Prevention is typically achieved through encryption, making prevention more effective than detection for this class of attacks.

## Active Attacks
Active attacks involve modification of data flows or the creation of false data streams. They can be classified into four categories:

### Replay
Involves the passive capture of a data unit followed by its retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect.

### Masquerade
Occurs when an entity pretends to be a different legitimate entity.

### Message Modification
Involves altering portions of a legitimate message, delaying messages, or reordering them to produce an unauthorized effect. For example, modifying a message from “Allow John Smith to read accounts containing confidential files” to “Allow Fred Brown to read accounts containing confidential files.”

### Denial of Service (DoS)
Prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communication facilities. A DoS attack may target a specific service, such as suppressing security audit logs, or disrupt an entire network by disabling infrastructure or overwhelming it with excessive traffic to degrade performance.
