## Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data about cyber threats with the objective of preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks before they cause damage. It focuses on understanding who the attackers are, how they operate, which targets they pursue, and how an organization can defend itself against them.

Threat Intelligence is derived from multiple sources, including:
- System and security logs
- Historical incident data
- Dark web monitoring
- IOC (Indicators of Compromise) feeds
- Information sharing between organizations and security communities

At its core, Threat Intelligence means using knowledge about cyber attacks to better protect a network or system. It enables security teams to stay one step ahead of adversaries by understanding their behavior, tools, and targets.

## Why Threat Intelligence Matters
Threat Intelligence enables proactive security actions. Instead of reacting only after an attack occurs, organizations can anticipate threats, identify vulnerabilities exploited by specific threat actors, adapt defenses based on real and current threats, reduce risk exposure, and shorten incident response times.

Without Threat Intelligence, security operations tend to be reactive, slow, and less effective. With it, security teams gain critical context, accuracy, and speed in decision-making.

## Threat Intelligence Levels
Threat Intelligence is commonly categorized into three main levels, each serving a different audience and purpose:

### Strategic Threat Intelligence
- Target audience: Executive leadership and senior management
- Focus: Global threat trends, risk landscapes, and business impact
- Purpose: Support strategic decision-making, risk management, and investment planning

### Tactical Threat Intelligence
- Target audience: Security and defense teams
- Focus: Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Purpose: Improve detection capabilities, defensive strategies, and security controls

### Operational Threat Intelligence
- Target audience: SOC analysts and incident responders
- Focus: Technical indicators such as IP addresses, domains, malware samples, file hashes, and attack infrastructure
- Purpose: Enable detection, investigation, and response at the technical level
