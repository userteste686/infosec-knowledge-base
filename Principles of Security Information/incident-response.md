## Incident Response (IR)

Incident Response (IR) is a structured set of processes, techniques, and coordinated actions performed by a security team to identify, contain, eradicate, investigate, recover from, and document a security incident. It follows a formal lifecycle, commonly aligned with frameworks such as NIST SP 800-61 or SANS, and aims to minimize impact, restore operations, and prevent recurrence.

Incident Response integrates technologies and disciplines such as SIEM, EDR/XDR, digital forensics, behavioral analysis, threat intelligence, and coordination with technical and business stakeholders. Incident Response exists because cyber attacks are inevitable, and without a defined process, the impact of an incident can be catastrophic.

## Incident Response Lifecycle
The core stages of Incident Response are:

### Preparation
Establishing the incident response team, tools, playbooks, monitoring capabilities, communication channels, and clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

### Identification / Detection
Analyzing alerts, logs, and indicators to determine whether a security incident is occurring and to assess its scope and severity.

### Containment
Immediate actions taken to limit damage and prevent further spread, such as isolating endpoints, blocking malicious IPs, disabling compromised accounts, and applying network segmentation.

### Eradication
Eliminating the root cause of the incident, including removing malware, revoking compromised credentials, closing backdoors, and patching exploited vulnerabilities.

### Recovery
Restoring affected systems and services, validating system integrity, strengthening security controls, and returning operations to a normal and stable state.

### Lessons Learned
Comprehensive documentation of the incident, including timelines, metrics, root cause analysis, and improvements to processes, controls, and defensive strategies.

## Why Incident Response Is Essential
Incident Response is critical to:

- Rapidly reduce damage and impact
- Recover systems in a controlled and secure manner
- Understand how the attack occurred
- Prevent similar incidents from happening again
- Demonstrate governance, accountability, and regulatory compliance

Incident Response was created to ensure that organizations respond to security incidents in a fast, coordinated, and effective manner—transforming chaos into control during security crises.
